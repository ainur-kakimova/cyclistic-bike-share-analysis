# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

This project was completed as part of the **Google Data Analytics Capstone** on Coursera. It explores ride data from Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago, to uncover user behavior patterns and support business decisions.

## Objective

The goal is to analyze differences between **casual riders** and **annual members**, and provide insights to help Cyclistic convert more casual riders into paying members.

## Project Structure

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Using SQL in Google BigQuery to clean and combine 12 months of ride data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Conducted using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** in **Google Colab**, together with SQL-based summaries.
- **Dashboard Visualization**: Built in **Tableau Public** to present findings interactively.
- **Business Recommendations**: Derived from behavioral trends observed in the data.
